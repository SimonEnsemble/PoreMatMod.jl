`PoreMatMod.jl` is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package for working with graph representations of and modifying crystal structures of porous crystals.

Use cases:

:hammer: subgraph matching to filter databases of crystal structures

:hammer: create hypothetical crystal structure models of functionalized structures

:hammer: introduce defects into crystal structures

:hammer: repair artifacts of X-ray structure determination, such as missing hydrogen atoms, disorder, and guest molecules

See documentation [here](https://SimonEnsemble.github.io/PoreMatMod.jl/) and examples (in [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks) [here](https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/PoreMatMod.jl/tree/master/examples).

N.b. while `PoreMatMod.jl` was developed for MOFs and other porous crystalline materials, it works with discrete molecular structures as well.
